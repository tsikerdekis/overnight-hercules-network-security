# Prebuilt Dashboards

Some of the dashboards that are shown throughout the book were exported so that it can be easily imported for convenience. If your goal is to learn DO NOT use them. Use the chapter guides instead to build them yourself.

You can download the dashboards from the following links:

1. [Alerts Dashboard](saved-objects/alerts-2.16.ndjson)
2. [Device Fingerprinting](saved-objects/device-fingerprinting-2.16.ndjson)
3. [DNS Dashboard](saved-objects/dns-2.16.ndjson)
4. [NetFlow Dashboard](saved-objects/netflow-2.16.ndjson)
5. [Insider Threat Dashboard](saved-objects/insider-threat-2.16.ndjson)

These include the default index pattern that I used when I exported them, which include scripted fields. 

To import them, follow the steps below:

1.  Go to the Opensearch Dashboards interface.
2.  Click on the gear icon on the left side.
3.  Click on `Dashboard Management`.
4.  Click on `Saved Objects`.
5.  Click on `Import`.
6.  Select the downloaded file.
7.  Keep the setting to automatically replace index patterns. Click `Import`.
